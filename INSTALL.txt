X must be run at 320x200 pixels, matching the LCD display resolution.
As the framebuffer contents is send as-is, the resolution and display 
depth must match exactly, otherwise the display would be garbled.
Run the following command to set up a matching X configuration:

sudo cp 10-monitors.conf /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d


Start X:

startx &

Start this driver:

./fb &



You should see the X desktop appear on the display.
